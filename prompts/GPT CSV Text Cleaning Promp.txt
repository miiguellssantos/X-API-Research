I will upload one or more CSV files. For each file, I want you to:

	1. Clean the Text column by:

	    - Removing URLs, usernames (@someone), and special characters.

	    - Converting all text to lowercase.

	    - Removing common English stop words.

	2. Replace the original Text column with the cleaned version (don’t 	add a new column).

	3. Return the cleaned version of the file as a downloadable CSV.

Some of the files may be very large, so handle them efficiently if needed (e.g., in chunks).

Let me upload the first one — just analyze it first so you understand the structure.
