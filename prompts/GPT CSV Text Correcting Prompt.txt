I will upload one or more CSV files containing tweet data with the following 9 fields:
- geo ? JSON.stringify(tweet.geo) : 'N/A'
- created_at
- like_count || 0
- retweet_count || 0
- id
- username || 'N/A'
- text.replace(/\n/g, ' ')
- location || 'N/A'
- followers_count || 0

These files are often messy, inconsistent, and poorly structured. I want you to:

1. Clean and correct all formatting issues.
2. Apply the following standards:
   - Missing Geo, Created At, Tweet ID, Username, Text, User Location: fill with "N/A".
   - Missing Likes, Retweets, Followers Count: fill with 0 and convert to integers.
   - Convert Tweet ID to string to prevent scientific notation.
   - Clean up Text field by:
     - Removing URLs, mentions (@username), special characters, and newlines.
     - Converting everything to lowercase.
     - Removing common stop words.
     - Replacing the original Text column (no new column).
   - Strip whitespace and normalize all string fields.
3. Split files only if needed (e.g., more than 100,000 rows).
4. Return the final product as downloadable CSV file(s).

I will also upload a sample corrected file to use as the formatting reference. Use it to match output structure and quality.
